## Julia Implement Numerical Differential Equations

### Brief Introduction
Julia Implementation of some numerial ode/pde methods.

### Note
- We first solve the [initial value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem#:~:text=In%20multivariable%20calculus%2C%20an%20initial,solving%20an%20initial%20value%20problem.)(which we also call cauchy initial value problem). We define the IVP by the library [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/) rather than define from scratch.
